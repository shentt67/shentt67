### Hi, Welcome! 👋
***
- 🏫 I am currently a 4-th year undergraduate student in Whuhan University, Hubei Province, China. 
- 🚲 My subject is software engineering, and I used to be a front-end engineer. In 2022, I participate in creating a company called UnknowByte, and developed a app as the front-end leader about NFT (Digital Collections and Blockchain, you can find introduction in Wikipedia [Intro of NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)) with my friends. And our platform recieved more than 200k registers. Due to the busy study and other aspects of reasons, we disbanded after half years.
- 🚗 Now I am interested in AI. My study about AI began in October, 2022. I have contributed two CCF-A papers. I used to study on Person Re-identification and Graph Learning, and now my interests are Multi-modal Recommendation and Diffusion Model. Welcome to communicate if you have the same interests! And here is my WeChat qrcode:

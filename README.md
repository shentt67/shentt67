### Hi, Welcome! 👋
***
- 🏫 I am currently a 4-th year undergraduate student in **Whuhan University**, Hubei Province, China. 
- 🚲 My subject is software engineering, and I used to be a front-end engineer. In 2022, I participate in creating a company called **UnknowByte**, and developed a app as the front-end leader about **NFT** with my friends (Digital Collections and Blockchain, you can find introduction in Wikipedia [Intro of NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)). And our platform recieved more than **200k registers**. Due to the busy study and other aspects of reasons, we disbanded after half years.
- 🚗 Now I am interested in AI. My study on AI began in October, 2022. I have **contributed two CCF-A papers**. I used to study on **Person Re-identification** and **Graph Learning**, and now my interests are **Multi-modal Recommendation** and **Diffusion Model**. Welcome to communicate if you have the same interests! Email at **weishen@whu.edu.cn**.
